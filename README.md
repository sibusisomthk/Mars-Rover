# Mars-Rover


Assumptions Made:

-rovers can fill a 1/3 of the world/plateau
-upperright coordinate must be greater  than the bottom left coordinates
-rover comes to a complete stop if there is an obsticle ahead(another rover or out of world/plateau boundry),the rest of its    instructions are ignored
-two rovers cannot be deployed on the same position.
